# Hygge
The Hygge app
<br><br>

Hygge is a mobile application developed entirely for the Android platform and its purpose is to connect with people who have similar interests. The user can easily log in either with a Gmail or a Facebook account and post his activity: what he would like to do, when and where.
The project is built entirely in Java, XML, and C#, with a personalized logo. The log in possibility and the database are implemented through Firebase. The user's activity can be anything he would like, from sports activities to board games or gaming. The time is chosen through a clock display and the location can either be the device location or a random place chosen by the user (e.g. the local gym) implemented through the Google Maps service.
